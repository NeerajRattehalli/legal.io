CodeX is a collaboration between Stanford’s Law School and Department of Computer Science that strives to bring transparency to the legal technology field. One of its projects is the legal tech list which is a list of 1800 legal tech companies that were compiled onto the list. The goal of the list is to track data that we hope can be used to correlate certain factors to success. Some of these factors include location, category, and founding date. The list also has links to the company’s social media such as the main URL, Facebook, Twitter, and Crunchbase. In order to gather all of the data and check existing data we wrote many scripts which were all published here. We also created a pipeline which can be used to gather data on a company in the future. We also published code that determines the average success rating of a company by measuring social media activity. Another example is code that categorizes the company based on age that were collected from the company description.
