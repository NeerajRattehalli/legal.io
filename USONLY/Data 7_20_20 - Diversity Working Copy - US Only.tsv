B	Directive Communication Systems, Inc.	2015	Boston, MA	x	Practice Management	n/a	n/a	Technology has made lives easier, however, for trusts and estates it has created a growing $7 trillion problem. More specifically, for estate professionals website owners and government agencies, it poses new and significant challenges to existing practice and protocols. The average person now has over 130 accounts including financial, social media, email, cloud based storage, eCommerce, cryptocurrency and many more.

Legal professionals and loved ones face a large and intricate maze of privacy policies, account holder agreements (TOSA) and governmental statutes designed to protect account holder privacy. Between digital assets, statutory and contractual mandates, and the sheer volume of accounts, the industry needs a solution now.     Directive Communication Systems, (DCS), where technology meets the outdated world of Trusts and Estates. DCS is the first and only technology based solution streamlining and networking digital asset and online account directives management. DCS provides an easy use to platform for identifying, organizing and cataloging all types of digital assets in preparation for estate affairs.

DCS simplifies estate administration by handling the communication of final wishes to site owners. In addition to NOT taking account passwords nor knowing the contents of an account, DCS is compliant to site owner Terms of Service Agreements and existing statutes, reducing costs and frustration. For website owners, DCS delivers improved efficiency for account holder death process management with streamlined notifications and online options administration. Ultimately, DCS will deliver a complete data communication network connecting all stakeholders including website owners, estates and government, speeding up a several month process to mere minutes.	https://www.directivecommunications.com	@directivecomms	https://angel.co/company/directive-communication-systems	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/directive-communication-systems	https://www.linkedin.com/company/directive-communication-systems	https://www.facebook.com/directivecomms/	rufadaa, estate planning, digital assets, trusts & estates, estate planning, trusts	active

B	Estate Guru	2014	Provo, UT	x	Document Automation	n/a	n/a	Having helped thousands of people with their estate plans we knew there was a simpler and smarter way. So we assembled the best people we could find – visionaries, techies, programmers, digital media marketers, attorneys, and financial planners. All with one purpose – to create a revolutionary new tool – Estate Guru. While Estate Guru is new, the knowledge and analytics behind it are not. Our team’s intimate knowledge and extensive experience covers every area of the estate planning process. Our collective expertise has been worked into the tool to create and manage estate plans that fit every unique need without breaking the bank. The platform has been designed to create documents in real time for simple accounts while aggressively looking for circumstances that need a traditional approach. Once the attorney has signed off on the legal logic in the tool and has approved the document templates as appropriate for the state(s) they practice, the platform allows the attorney to seamlessly scale their estate planning practice. Attorneys are now able to extend their practice into the offices of financial advisors or the homes of clients. In addition to generating revenue for all the automated work, attorneys get to personally service all the accounts that are too complicated for automation. These complicated accounts can then be billed at the attorneys normal rate. So Estate Guru becomes a way to find profitable accounts. The platform continually reaches out to clients to keep the client and the attorney informed of any life events that may require an update to their estate plan. In this sense, Estate Guru acts as an estate planning CRM. Finally, when clients die, the attorney is notified so they can help with the estate settlement work. Think volume.	https://estateguru.com	@estategurus	https://angel.co/company/estateguru	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/estateguru	https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-guru	https://www.facebook.com/EstatePlanGuru/	estate planning, automation, powers of attorney, wills, trusts, crm	active

B	Tomorrow Ideas	2016	Seattle, WA	x	Marketplace	Individuals	Legal Service Using Tech	The Tomorrow app helps organize your family finances and make decisions for the future — from insurance and inheritance to investments.  1. Insurance - Rest assured that your family is taken care of without your earning power. 2. Inheritance - Choose 3* roles: executor, guardians, and heirs and get a legal will, for free. 3. Investments - Organize your finances to see your net worth and get a living trust, for free  Now you can take these 3 tasks off your permanent to-do list and do them right on your phone with the Tomorrow app. You can plan your Tomorrow on a flight, over a cup of coffee, or after family dinner—all from the comfort of your home.  Without Tomorrow, you'd have to coordinate with a financial advisor, an insurance agent, and an estate planning attorney and then you'd still be left with a long to do list of forms, that are out-of-date as soon as they are done.  Instead, Tomorrow designed a visual way to help you get organized and make financial decisions for your family's future. You'll quickly forget why you put this off for so long and will feel good getting everything done at once.  Tomorrow built a one-of-a-kind platform from the ground up to help families make important legal, insurance, and financial decisions—without having to waste time and energy doing it the old-fashioned way.	https://tomorrow.me/	@tomorrowideas	https://angel.co/tomorrow-ideas	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tomorrow-4#section-overview	https://www.linkedin.com/company/tomorrow-ideas-inc./	https://www.facebook.com/tomorrowideas/	n/a	active

good	ContractRoom	2002	San Mateo, CA, USA	x	Document Automation	n/a	n/a	ContractRoom is a cloud-based negotiation and contract lifecycle management system that changes the way deals get done and how decisions are made. There is a clear distinction between ContractRoom and its competitors, which allows for improved business productivity and predictability. Those differentiators are: Collaboration and Control - it covers the entire process of communication, reviewing, editing, approving and tasking both internally in an organization as well as externally with counterparties. Imagine never having to play a game of email ping-pong again or decipher a redlined MSWord circulated internally and/or externally to determine the sequence in which changes had been made! Or, no long having to constantly check you are working on the correct version of a document when working with multiple parties. ContractRoom does away with all this annoyance!; Transaction and Behavior Data - it captures and leverages transaction and behavior data from the entire back-and-forth negotiation, not just final outcome. ContractRoom keeps a data record of every negotiation offer and counter on any business term or legal clause as well as tracking how long it takes (“timers”) and how many changes are made (“counters”). Once these data sets are aggregated, the system can make inferences for future deal-making and decision-making in real-time, what we call Predictive AgreementTM. So, negotiators no longer have to operate in a vacuum; instead, they benefit from the “collective intelligence” of their peers and can collaborate in a more informed way so as to achieve better business outcomes.	http://www.contractroom.com	@contractroom	https://angel.co/contract-room	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/contract-room#/entity	http://www.linkedin.com/company/contractroom	https://www.facebook.com/contractroomproduct/	contract management, contract lifecycle management, negotiation	active

Early 2016 we were the first in Europe to add proof of existence (using the Bitcoin blockchain) in our application for the documents being signed / agreed. By doing so we introduced the blockchain to organizations, showing it was useful for more than digital currency.  In 2017 we introduced LiveContracts; A platform to model agreements in such a way that they are easily understandable for both computers and humans.  Breaking down an agreement or law in these understandable pieces has the added benefit that some parts (those considered simple and safe enough) can be executed by computers that have no or very basic AI.

good	EDZ Systems	2015	Overland Park, Kansas	x	Document Automation	n/a	n/a	EDZ Systems Launches Intelligent RMSTM  First Tool of Its Kind to Integrate Law Firm Data In One Intelligent System  OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (August 28, 2018) – EDZ Systems today announced the launch of Intelligent RMS, a software solution designed to make law firms and corporate legal departments more informed, adaptable and strategic by bringing together all of their data on one intelligent platform.  Most law firms don’t lack data. They have a significant volume of business intelligence from multiple software sources – matter management, timekeeping, finance, human resources, marketing and more – as well as offline documents. However, as this information sits in disconnected systems and spreadsheets, law firm leaders don’t get a complete view of the business.  That’s where Intelligent RMS can help, said Elizabeth DeZeeuw, the president and CEO of EDZ Systems.  “Unlike any other product on the market today, Intelligent RMS helps legal teams see the big picture so they can make better decisions faster. This can lead to smarter business development, resource utilization and client management, as well as revenue growth and cost elimination,” she said. “It provides law firms the actionable optics to deliver better service for their clients and stronger profit for their partners.”  How it Works  Data visibility has been a critically lacking component of law firm management, DeZeeuw said. According to a study by FRONTEO, just 40 percent of law firms have dashboarding capabilities, compared to nearly three-fourths of corporations.  Indeed, data is often spread across law firms in separate systems that don’t integrate. Intelligent RMS brings together data from existing siloed applications into a single real-time display.  It’s common for law firms to use one provider for timekeeping and billing, and another for financial analysis, and still another for client contact information, DeZeeuw said. Intelligent RMS works across vendors, platforms and technologies; it can incorporate data onto a law firm dashboard regardless of source.  Corporate legal departments also can utilize Intelligent RMS to streamline their data and resources, DeZeeuw said.  Doug Doerfler, a former AmLaw 200 chief financial officer and Intelligent RMS user, said the software delivers ROI for law firms by improving efficiency, eliminating manual processes and focusing resources on the activities that matter most.  “In more than 20 years, I have not seen such a valuable solution,” Doerfler said. “This platform fills an important gap for firms, providing leaders real-time visibility across their business – and access to information in seconds. This increases efficiency in key areas: resource, matter, project, practice and lateral management.”  As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, Intelligent RMS is available for a per-user monthly fee plus an implementation charge based on firm size. There are no hardware or server requirements.  Following integration – which is estimated to take days, not months– users have access to centralized data and can create custom displays or dashboards.  More information is available at www.edzsystems.com.  About the Company  Based in Overland Park, Kan., EDZ Systems was founded by technology professionals that were former executives at DST Systems, an international leader in financial and healthcare software solutions. Their corporate experience inspired Intelligent RMS.  A certified minority- and woman-owned firm, EDZ Systems offers law firm users a foundation of industry best practices and technologies. Prior to launch, the company tested and validated Intelligent RMS in AmLaw 200 firms.

good	Estate Apps LLC	2020	San Francisco, CA	x	Marketplace	n/a	CourtCorrect tells you what's in all the terms and conditions and contracts you just accept.	Estate App LLC develops Apps that enable law firms to solve legal client issues while boosting the law firms' marketing.    The Estate Attorney App available on iOS and Android enables law firms to provide clients with a property memo generation tool for completing a property memo -- something that nearly 70% of clients currently do not complete.  The property memo is essential as it designates who is to get a client's personal items upon their death.  Without a completed property memo, beneficiaries are left to divide the sentimental items themselves leading to fights among family members.  An unfinished memo is also a loss for the law firm as it means the firm misses out on billable work reviewing the memo for legal compliance.   The Estate Attorney App enables subscribing law firms to provide a tool that empowers clients by removing the previous barriers to creating the memo.  Specifically, the barriers in the past was the memo was 1) difficult to put together with items located in various places (e.g., banks, closets, locker storage) but having to type it into a desktop computer (solution: mobile app) and 2) difficult to describe similarly looking items (e.g., jewelry or clothing) with just words (solution: include pictures).  The App solves all these problems by making memo generation simple, and importantly, when the memo is to be updated in the future, the information is stored within the device.    The App is also a marketing tool as law firm information is displayed every time the client opens the App and provides an in device annual notification reminding clients to consider updating their estate plan.  It enables law firms to stand apart from other firms while clients perceive the firm as providing high-value.	https://www.estateappsllc.com	n/a	n/a	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/estate-apps	https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-apps	n/a	n/a	active

	thingsTHINKING GmbH	2017	Karlsruhe, Germany		E-Discovery	n/a	n/a	The semantic modeling of clauses and texts - aka understanding the meaning of clauses - enables the system to assess the clauses and contracts holistically. It allows a direct comparison of contracts based on their meaning rather than on the actual wording. Using this technology, the system can come up with similar clauses during writing, highlight duplicates and potential contradictions.  Another use case is to automatically process, understand, route, and compare incoming documents with internal standards.  Additionally, the semantic processing of contract text through AI can help by detecting inapplicable, missing information, and unclear formulation  as depicted below. The system suggests potential flaws in clauses and makes optimization suggestions to the editor of the contract.  The system is provided as micro services and can therefore integrate into any given (computerized) process within a law firm. We are aware of the fact that there is no standard for the legal domain rather than historically developed internal “standards” for software usage per each law firm/practise.	https://thingsTHINKING.net	@ttgmbh	n/a	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thingsthinking	https://www.linkedin.com/company/thingsthinking	n/a	semantics, nlu, nlp	inactive
