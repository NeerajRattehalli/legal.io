Beagle.ai	2014	Ontario, Canada	Analytics	Service Providers	Unknown	Finding the detail in a contract need not be painful, costly or time consuming. Understanding your contract minimizes business risk and provides exceptional efficiencies. Beagle™ sniffs out the fine print, so you don’t have to.™   Beagle is a productivity tool that analyzes contracts and presents key information in a clear and interactive way. Through highly sophisticated machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) methods, Beagle can read a contract and within seconds highlight what you need to know. The responsibilities, liabilities, how to terminate, and more!   Our market on ramp is SME's, 50 employees and less. Finance executives and senior leaders will be targeted. Reading contracts is not their core responsibility, but they are often tasked with it because they are the end decision makers. It takes time and resources to understand these contracts. Beagle provides an excellent return on time (ROT), at a negligible lost opportunity cost (LOC).	http://beagle.ai/	https://twitter.com/beagleinc	https://angel.co/beagle-2	0	0	0	document automation, machine learning

ContractRoom	2002	San Mateo, CA, USA	Document Automation	Unknown	Unknown	ContractRoom is a cloud-based negotiation and contract lifecycle management system that changes the way deals get done and how decisions are made. There is a clear distinction between ContractRoom and its competitors, which allows for improved business productivity and predictability. Those differentiators are: Collaboration and Control - it covers the entire process of communication, reviewing, editing, approving and tasking both internally in an organization as well as externally with counterparties. Imagine never having to play a game of email ping-pong again or decipher a redlined MSWord circulated internally and/or externally to determine the sequence in which changes had been made! Or, no long having to constantly check you are working on the correct version of a document when working with multiple parties. ContractRoom does away with all this annoyance!; Transaction and Behavior Data - it captures and leverages transaction and behavior data from the entire back-and-forth negotiation, not just final outcome. ContractRoom keeps a data record of every negotiation offer and counter on any business term or legal clause as well as tracking how long it takes (“timers”) and how many changes are made (“counters”). Once these data sets are aggregated, the system can make inferences for future deal-making and decision-making in real-time, what we call Predictive AgreementTM. So, negotiators no longer have to operate in a vacuum; instead, they benefit from the “collective intelligence” of their peers and can collaborate in a more informed way so as to achieve better business outcomes.	http://www.contractroom.com	@contractroom	https://angel.co/contract-room	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/contract-room#/entity	http://www.linkedin.com/company/contractroom		contract management, contract lifecycle management, negotiation

Estate Guru	2014	 Provo, UT	Document Automation	Unknown	Unknown	Having helped thousands of people with their estate plans we knew there was a simpler and smarter way. So we assembled the best people we could find – visionaries, techies, programmers, digital media marketers, attorneys, and financial planners. All with one purpose – to create a revolutionary new tool – Estate Guru. While Estate Guru is new, the knowledge and analytics behind it are not. Our team’s intimate knowledge and extensive experience covers every area of the estate planning process. Our collective expertise has been worked into the tool to create and manage estate plans that fit every unique need without breaking the bank. The platform has been designed to create documents in real time for simple accounts while aggressively looking for circumstances that need a traditional approach. Once the attorney has signed off on the legal logic in the tool and has approved the document templates as appropriate for the state(s) they practice, the platform allows the attorney to seamlessly scale their estate planning practice. Attorneys are now able to extend their practice into the offices of financial advisors or the homes of clients. In addition to generating revenue for all the automated work, attorneys get to personally service all the accounts that are too complicated for automation. These complicated accounts can then be billed at the attorneys normal rate. So Estate Guru becomes a way to find profitable accounts. The platform continually reaches out to clients to keep the client and the attorney informed of any life events that may require an update to their estate plan. In this sense, Estate Guru acts as an estate planning CRM. Finally, when clients die, the attorney is notified so they can help with the estate settlement work. Think volume.	https://estateguru.com	@estategurus	0	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/estate-guru?utm_source=crunchbase&utm_medium=export&utm_campaign=odm_csv	https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-guru	https://www.facebook.com/EstatePlanGuru/	estate planning, automation, powers of attorney, wills, trusts, crm

By doing so we introduced the blockchain to organizations, showing it was useful for more than digital currency.  In 2017 we introduced LiveContracts; A platform to model agreements in such a way that they are easily understandable for both computers and humans.  Breaking down an agreement or law in these understandable pieces has the added benefit that some parts (those considered simple and safe enough) can be executed by computers that have no or very basic AI. Other parts can be left to human interpretation.  	livecontracts.io	@livecontracts	0	0	0	0	blockchain, smart contracts

thingsTHINKING GmbH	2017	Karlsruhe, Germany	E-Discovery	0	0	The semantic modeling of clauses and texts - aka understanding the meaning of clauses - enables the system to assess the clauses and contracts holistically. It allows a direct comparison of contracts based on their meaning rather than on the actual wording. Using this technology, the system can come up with similar clauses during writing, highlight duplicates and potential contradictions.  Another use case is to automatically process, understand, route, and compare incoming documents with internal standards.  Additionally, the semantic processing of contract text through AI can help by detecting inapplicable, missing information, and unclear formulation  as depicted below. The system suggests potential flaws in clauses and makes optimization suggestions to the editor of the contract.  The system is provided as micro services and can therefore integrate into any given (computerized) process within a law firm. We are aware of the fact that there is no standard for the legal domain rather than historically developed internal “standards” for software usage per each law firm/practise. 	thingsTHINKING.net	@ttgmbh	0	0	0	0	semantics, nlu, nlp

Upsolve	2016	Brooklyn, New York, United States	Marketplace -	Unknown	Legal Service Using Tech	We’ve built the equivalent of “TurboTax” for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Using a guided, easy to understand online survey, users answer questions about what they own, earn and spend. We take their answers and automatically generate the paperwork they need to file for bankruptcy. After completing our survey, all our users need to do is print out the paperwork they receive and deliver it to the clerk’s office at the court.  Bankruptcy is one of the most transformative forms of legal relief. Yet few Americans file because they can’t afford a $1,300 lawyer. Legal aid clinics don’t have enough free lawyers and the forms are impossible to complete without help. We hope that our product can make bankruptcy accessible for low-income Americans who cannot afford lawyers.	upsolve.org	@upsolvebk	https://angel.co/upsolve-1	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prudence-lasb#section-overview	https://www.linkedin.com/company/upsolve/	https://www.facebook.com/upsolvebankruptcy/	0

Tomorrow Ideas	2016	Seattle, WA	Marketplace -	Individuals	Legal Service Using Tech	The Tomorrow app helps organize your family finances and make decisions for the future — from insurance and inheritance to investments.  1. Insurance - Rest assured that your family is taken care of without your earning power. 2. Inheritance - Choose 3* roles: executor, guardians, and heirs and get a legal will, for free. 3. Investments - Organize your finances to see your net worth and get a living trust, for free  Now you can take these 3 tasks off your permanent to-do list and do them right on your phone with the Tomorrow app. You can plan your Tomorrow on a flight, over a cup of coffee, or after family dinner—all from the comfort of your home.  Without Tomorrow, you'd have to coordinate with a financial advisor, an insurance agent, and an estate planning attorney and then you'd still be left with a long to do list of forms, that are out-of-date as soon as they are done.  Instead, Tomorrow designed a visual way to help you get organized and make financial decisions for your family's future. You'll quickly forget why you put this off for so long and will feel good getting everything done at once.  Tomorrow built a one-of-a-kind platform from the ground up to help families make important legal, insurance, and financial decisions—without having to waste time and energy doing it the old-fashioned way.  	https://tomorrow.me/	@tomorrowideas	https://angel.co/tomorrow-ideas	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tomorrow-4#section-overview	https://www.linkedin.com/company/tomorrow-ideas-inc./	https://www.facebook.com/tomorrowideas/	0

Vaultedge Software	2015	Bangalore, India	Document Automation	0	0	Vaultedge automates Legal Contract reviews. The software helps lawyers as well as other business users to automatically review contracts, identify risks, make changes and create summaries. Users save upto 90% of time reviewing contracts using Vaultedge.   Reviewing contracts and identifying obligations & risks is a critical process in Contract management. Today this process is completely manual with legal and contract management professionals reading through contracts, comparing with standard approved positions and identifying risks. Each such review takes 3 to 4 hours. This leads to long contract negotiating cycle leading and lost or delayed revenues.   Vaultedge uses artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to understand Contracts the way a lawyer does. With Vaultedge, you can upload a contract and see the risks (deviations from standard template) highlighted in less than 60 seconds. Vaultedge also suggests alternate language for clauses. We achieved this by building an AI platform for unstructured data and training it over 1000s of contracts to accurately identify more than 300 clauses and data points. Using Vaultedge, companies can save 90% of time spent reviewing contracts. Most importantly, with Vaultedge any body can accurately review contracts.	www.vaultedge.com	@vaultedgetweets	https://angel.co/vaultedge-1/	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/vaultedge	0	0	contract review, contract abstraction, contract analysis, document automation, contract automation, legal technology

filerskeepers	2018	Amsterdam, the Netherlands	Compliance	0	0	filerskeepers helps companies decide which retention period to choose per system or document category. filerskeepers provides data retention schedules that give insight into the legal maximum and minimum retention periods applicable in the countries relevant to them. This helps companies to justify why they are storing data (“for compliance with income tax rules”) and for how long (“for 10 years from the date following the end of the book year").   filerskeepers was inspired by a problem many companies experience: there was no simple way for IT, Legal, Compliance, HR, Sales, Finance, Health and Safety and other business departments to build records retention schedules and keep them up to date.   filerskeepers believes that companies should be able to know all retention periods that apply to them. It is our goal to make sure companies will be up to date about the latest data retention periods. At any time. This will allow companies to find their golden standard retention period that they can actually implement into their IT-systems.  As we got to know our users, we discovered that data retention is not a one-size-fits-all. Companies keep data of all shapes, sizes and types—they use it in many different ways. Our goal is to make a strategic data retention tool that allows you to know all data retention terms, to see changes in data retention laws realtime and to know what the golden standard your organisation should apply. 	www.filerskeepers.co	@filerskeepers	https://angel.co/filerskeepers	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/filerskeepers	0	0	data compliance, data retention, records retention

EDZ Systems	2015	Overland Park, Kansas	Document Automation	0	0	EDZ Systems Launches Intelligent RMSTM  First Tool of Its Kind to Integrate Law Firm Data In One Intelligent System  OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (August 28, 2018) – EDZ Systems today announced the launch of Intelligent RMS, a software solution designed to make law firms and corporate legal departments more informed, adaptable and strategic by bringing together all of their data on one intelligent platform.  Most law firms don’t lack data. They have a significant volume of business intelligence from multiple software sources – matter management, timekeeping, finance, human resources, marketing and more – as well as offline documents. However, as this information sits in disconnected systems and spreadsheets, law firm leaders don’t get a complete view of the business.  That’s where Intelligent RMS can help, said Elizabeth DeZeeuw, the president and CEO of EDZ Systems.  “Unlike any other product on the market today, Intelligent RMS helps legal teams see the big picture so they can make better decisions faster. This can lead to smarter business development, resource utilization and client management, as well as revenue growth and cost elimination,” she said. “It provides law firms the actionable optics to deliver better service for their clients and stronger profit for their partners.”  How it Works  Data visibility has been a critically lacking component of law firm management, DeZeeuw said. According to a study by FRONTEO, just 40 percent of law firms have dashboarding capabilities, compared to nearly three-fourths of corporations.  Indeed, data is often spread across law firms in separate systems that don’t integrate. Intelligent RMS brings together data from existing siloed applications into a single real-time display.  It’s common for law firms to use one provider for timekeeping and billing, and another for financial analysis, and still another for client contact information, DeZeeuw said. Intelligent RMS works across vendors, platforms and technologies; it can incorporate data onto a law firm dashboard regardless of source.  Corporate legal departments also can utilize Intelligent RMS to streamline their data and resources, DeZeeuw said.  Doug Doerfler, a former AmLaw 200 chief financial officer and Intelligent RMS user, said the software delivers ROI for law firms by improving efficiency, eliminating manual processes and focusing resources on the activities that matter most.  “In more than 20 years, I have not seen such a valuable solution,” Doerfler said. “This platform fills an important gap for firms, providing leaders real-time visibility across their business – and access to information in seconds. This increases efficiency in key areas: resource, matter, project, practice and lateral management.”  As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, Intelligent RMS is available for a per-user monthly fee plus an implementation charge based on firm size. There are no hardware or server requirements.  Following integration – which is estimated to take days, not months– users have access to centralized data and can create custom displays or dashboards.  More information is available at www.edzsystems.com.  About the Company  Based in Overland Park, Kan., EDZ Systems was founded by technology professionals that were former executives at DST Systems, an international leader in financial and healthcare software solutions. Their corporate experience inspired Intelligent RMS.  A certified minority- and woman-owned firm, EDZ Systems offers law firm users a foundation of industry best practices and technologies. Prior to launch, the company tested and validated Intelligent RMS in AmLaw 200 firms.

CoProcure, Inc.	2018	San Francisco, CA	Marketplace	0	0	CoProcure (coprocure.us) makes it easy for public agencies to purchase together. Each year, U.S. local and state government agencies spend $1.5T on goods and services. Even though agencies have similar needs, each agency typically spends ~200+ hours making a purchase on its own. Purchasing redundancies cost taxpayers billions of dollars each year.   Public agencies can purchase together, sharing procurement processes and contracts. Even though some of these contracts already exist, they can be challenging to find and use. CoProcure makes it easy to discover and utilize existing cooperative contracts, saving public agencies time and money.   We're an early-stage startup harnessing the power of purchasing to reinvest billions of dollars into our local communities. 	www.coprocure.us	@CoProcure	https://angel.co/coprocure	0	0	0	legaltech, govtech, government, procurement

The Corporation For Form Reform	2017	Toronto	Document Automation	0	0	Our tool enables self-represented litigants, lawyers and legal professionals by removing the complexity associated with determining which court mandated forms are required in any particular situation, and facilitating the completion of these forms. Incorrectly completed court forms are a common challenge for lawyers, legal professionals, and especially for self-represented litigants. We remedy this by providing our users with a simple, easy to use tool.  Our first online tool asks users to respond to simple questions that determine which family law forms will need to be filed with the courts to initiate or respond to family law matters. The questions take a range of scenarios into account, including divorce, child custody and property claims. Based on the user’s response, the tool asks only for the appropriate information the user will need to provide in order to complete the form properly. If a user needs to file multiple forms, the tool autofills answers to questions repeated on subsequent forms. Once the forms are completed, they're available to download or fax.   The tool is accompanied by a free guide called Common Sense Guide To Divorce in Ontario. The guide aims to help people better understand and cope with the stress of divorce and separation, giving some support to what is typically an arduous process.  Currently, the service is available to users in Ontario, Canada. In 2019 we will be offering the service in US jurisdictions, as well as expanding to other areas of law. 	https://www.ontariodivorceresource.ca/	na	na	na	0	0	, usability, a2j, automation, family law

Each department will be able to view and work only with the information they need in their own modules, i.e. each department will not see the other departments data. However, data which is needed in their respective process will be retrieved from other modules where it is available in order to avoid double work and increase quality and efficiency.	www.blika.com	0	0	0	0	0	legal operations solution

iolex limited	2018	Hong Kong	Compliance -	Unknown	Unknown	iolex limited helps law firms and their clients digitize their legal / compliance functions.  to this end, iolex offers (1)unified platform + legal tech app store (2)a proprietary high level language that lawyers and compliance officers can use to create their own apps, bypassing the programmer, and (3)a road map for redefining end-to-end legal service.  Think of the company ARM for lawyers.  iolex's founder and CEO Carl Im, a stanford phd in physics, with 20 years of investment banking trading, strategy, and sales experience, believes that the single most distinguishing factor of iolex is the tech leadership:  (1)status quo is to implement legaltech solution within the context of a given mandate --> iolex builds law firm business models around a suite of technology.  (2)status quo is to teach low level programming to lawyers --> we have trained 4 lawyers to speak iolex(a proprietary high level language) to create their own apps, bypassing the programmer.  We have apps with only 20 lines of iolex, and over 500 lines of iolex.  Carl Im is also a senior advisor to Yulchon LLC.  As a senior adviser at Yulchon LLC, he has been driving Yulchon’s digital strategy, eYulchon using the iolex paradigm.  Carl was named one of the 10 pioneers of new thinking by the London Financial Times, and his work has won the Asian Technology and Innovation Initiative of the Year, the Asia-Pacific Innovator of the Year, and the In-House Community Visionary Firm of the Year.  He has just published a paper in A.I. with MIT’s CSAIL.  The legal app factory that iolex is offering has created several revenue generating applications for Yulchon LLC and is currently in discussions with several international and regional law firms for collaboration.  Carl has just announced a FIDIC Yellow 99 compliance app in collaboration with Pinsent Masons.  At this years International Bar Association Conference, the iolex footprint in legaltech was the topic of invited talks for the Law Firm Management Committee, the Banking Law Committee, the Securities Law Committee, Stronger Together by Freshfields, the Fintech Settlement Committee, as well as the Yulchon Tax Breakfast.  Currently iolex offers three classes of applications: the award winning AlgoCompliance, legal risk assessment analytics, as well as the patent-pending semantic evolution engine, i7, that produces line-by-line reasoning for a legal argument.	www.iolex.com	0	0	0	0	0	legal practice management, computational law, legal document automation, ediscovery, legal analytics, legal research

Legalicity	2015	10 Dundas Street East, Toronto ON  M5B 2G9	Analytics -	Unknown	Unknown	Legalicity is the maker of NLPatent, an online tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. Our goal is to predict the success of patent applications, thereby reducing the uncertainty and the cost involved in seeking patent protection.  There are over 3,000,000 patent applications filed each year around the world, and that number is growing. But many of these applications are rejected, often because the proposed invention is too similar to existing technology. That means a lot of resources are wasted on unsuccessful applications, since getting a patent is very costly and time-consuming. NLPatent uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. This helps companies and inventors decide whether an invention is worth pursuing.

RechtEasy.at	2012	Staudgasse 54, Vienna, Austria, Europe	Legal Research	0	0	With over 6000 legal terms, RechtEasy.at - which was nominated as "Best Legal Tech Innovation 2019 service provider" - is Austria's largest free legal research tool. It was created in 2012 in cooperation with the university and its legal faculty representatives due to the need to explain Austrian legal terms in a transparent and simple manner, differentiated from German law. Most of the terms were created directly by our team in a phase of a year where we did nothing but to write articles. The long-awaited relaunch then took place in March 2019, which caused a sensation inside and outside the legal sector. Since then, the platform not only show legal terms, but also display all federal laws, including judicature, among the paragraphs and links them together.  In addition, there is a new and intuitive legal job advertisement plattform. Appropriate advertisements from the integrated job portal are automatically suggested to users who are looking for a legal term in the relevant field.

Estate Apps LLC	2020	San Francisco, CA	Marketplace	0	CourtCorrect tells you what's in all the terms and conditions and contracts you just accept.	Estate App LLC develops Apps that enable law firms to solve legal client issues while boosting the law firms' marketing.    The Estate Attorney App available on iOS and Android enables law firms to provide clients with a property memo generation tool for completing a property memo -- something that nearly 70% of clients currently do not complete.  The property memo is essential as it designates who is to get a client's personal items upon their death.  Without a completed property memo, beneficiaries are left to divide the sentimental items themselves leading to fights among family members.  An unfinished memo is also a loss for the law firm as it means the firm misses out on billable work reviewing the memo for legal compliance.   The Estate Attorney App enables subscribing law firms to provide a tool that empowers clients by removing the previous barriers to creating the memo.  Specifically, the barriers in the past was the memo was 1) difficult to put together with items located in various places (e.g., banks, closets, locker storage) but having to type it into a desktop computer (solution: mobile app) and 2) difficult to describe similarly looking items (e.g., jewelry or clothing) with just words (solution: include pictures).  The App solves all these problems by making memo generation simple, and importantly, when the memo is to be updated in the future, the information is stored within the device.    The App is also a marketing tool as law firm information is displayed every time the client opens the App and provides an in device annual notification reminding clients to consider updating their estate plan.  It enables law firms to stand apart from other firms while clients perceive the firm as providing high-value.	www.estateappsllc.com	0	0	0	0	0	0
