Task: to create a web-scraper that finds tags for companies that don't have tags already

1) Read from tags.txt and store the tags in an array
2) Now read from final.csv or final.tsv for main_urls 
3) Scrape text body of the website not the html just text using the main_urls to avoid automation protocol.
4) Search for the tags in the text body. Keep a count of it and the top most commonly found words.
5) Then add these tags to the csv
6) Make another file of the most commonly used tags amongst all the stuff

Deadline: Have the scraper done by Tuesday and run it
