Those differentiators are: Collaboration and Control - it covers the entire process of communication, reviewing, editing, approving and tasking both internally in an organization as well as externally with counterparties. Imagine never having to play a game of email ping-pong again or decipher a redlined MSWord circulated internally and/or externally to determine the sequence in which changes had been made! Or, no long having to constantly check you are working on the correct version of a document when working with multiple parties. ContractRoom does away with all this annoyance!; Transaction and Behavior Data - it captures and leverages transaction and behavior data from the entire back-and-forth negotiation, not just final outcome. ContractRoom keeps a data record of every negotiation offer and counter on any business term or legal clause as well as tracking how long it takes (“timers”) and how many changes are made (“counters”). Once these data sets are aggregated, the system can make inferences for future deal-making and decision-making in real-time, what we call Predictive AgreementTM. So, negotiators no longer have to operate in a vacuum; instead, they benefit from the “collective intelligence” of their peers and can collaborate in a more informed way so as to achieve better business outcomes.	n/a	@contractroom	https://angel.co/contract-room	n/a	http://www.linkedin.com/company/contractroom	https://www.facebook.com/contractroomproduct/	contract management, contract lifecycle management, negotiation	active

Estate Guru	2014	Provo, UT	Document Automation	n/a	n/a	Having helped thousands of people with their estate plans we knew there was a simpler and smarter way. So we assembled the best people we could find – visionaries, techies, programmers, digital media marketers, attorneys, and financial planners. All with one purpose – to create a revolutionary new tool – Estate Guru. While Estate Guru is new, the knowledge and analytics behind it are not. Our team’s intimate knowledge and extensive experience covers every area of the estate planning process. Our collective expertise has been worked into the tool to create and manage estate plans that fit every unique need without breaking the bank. The platform has been designed to create documents in real time for simple accounts while aggressively looking for circumstances that need a traditional approach. Once the attorney has signed off on the legal logic in the tool and has approved the document templates as appropriate for the state(s) they practice, the platform allows the attorney to seamlessly scale their estate planning practice. Attorneys are now able to extend their practice into the offices of financial advisors or the homes of clients. In addition to generating revenue for all the automated work, attorneys get to personally service all the accounts that are too complicated for automation. These complicated accounts can then be billed at the attorneys normal rate. So Estate Guru becomes a way to find profitable accounts. The platform continually reaches out to clients to keep the client and the attorney informed of any life events that may require an update to their estate plan. In this sense, Estate Guru acts as an estate planning CRM. Finally, when clients die, the attorney is notified so they can help with the estate settlement work. Think volume.	n/a	@estategurus	https://angel.co/company/estateguru	n/a	https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-guru	https://www.facebook.com/EstatePlanGuru/	estate planning, automation, powers of attorney, wills, trusts, crm	active

Rather than just generating text and automating signing, we focused on the logic within a contract. This allowed companies can run their in- and external business processes much more efficient.  Early 2016 we were the first in Europe to add proof of existence (using the Bitcoin blockchain) in our application for the documents being signed / agreed. By doing so we introduced the blockchain to organizations, showing it was useful for more than digital currency.  In 2017 we introduced LiveContracts; A platform to model agreements in such a way that they are easily understandable for both computers and humans.  Breaking down an agreement or law in these understandable pieces has the added benefit that some parts (those considered simple and safe enough) can be executed by computers that have no or very basic AI.

thingsTHINKING GmbH	2017	Karlsruhe, Germany	E-Discovery	n/a	n/a	The semantic modeling of clauses and texts - aka understanding the meaning of clauses - enables the system to assess the clauses and contracts holistically. It allows a direct comparison of contracts based on their meaning rather than on the actual wording. Using this technology, the system can come up with similar clauses during writing, highlight duplicates and potential contradictions.  Another use case is to automatically process, understand, route, and compare incoming documents with internal standards.  Additionally, the semantic processing of contract text through AI can help by detecting inapplicable, missing information, and unclear formulation  as depicted below. The system suggests potential flaws in clauses and makes optimization suggestions to the editor of the contract.  The system is provided as micro services and can therefore integrate into any given (computerized) process within a law firm. We are aware of the fact that there is no standard for the legal domain rather than historically developed internal “standards” for software usage per each law firm/practise. 	https://thingsTHINKING.net	@ttgmbh	n/a	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thingsthinking	https://www.linkedin.com/company/thingsthinking	n/a	semantics, nlu, nlp	inactive

Upsolve	2016	Brooklyn, New York, United States	Marketplace	n/a	Legal Service Using Tech	We’ve built the equivalent of “TurboTax” for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Using a guided, easy to understand online survey, users answer questions about what they own, earn and spend. We take their answers and automatically generate the paperwork they need to file for bankruptcy. After completing our survey, all our users need to do is print out the paperwork they receive and deliver it to the clerk’s office at the court.  Bankruptcy is one of the most transformative forms of legal relief. Yet few Americans file because they can’t afford a $1,300 lawyer. Legal aid clinics don’t have enough free lawyers and the forms are impossible to complete without help. We hope that our product can make bankruptcy accessible for low-income Americans who cannot afford lawyers.	 https://upsolve.org	@upsolvebk	https://angel.co/upsolve-1	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prudence-lasb#section-overview	https://www.linkedin.com/company/upsolve/	https://www.facebook.com/upsolvebankruptcy/	n/a	active

Tomorrow Ideas	2016	Seattle, WA	Marketplace	Individuals	Legal Service Using Tech	The Tomorrow app helps organize your family finances and make decisions for the future — from insurance and inheritance to investments.  1. Insurance - Rest assured that your family is taken care of without your earning power. 2. Inheritance - Choose 3* roles: executor, guardians, and heirs and get a legal will, for free. 3. Investments - Organize your finances to see your net worth and get a living trust, for free  Now you can take these 3 tasks off your permanent to-do list and do them right on your phone with the Tomorrow app. You can plan your Tomorrow on a flight, over a cup of coffee, or after family dinner—all from the comfort of your home.  Without Tomorrow, you'd have to coordinate with a financial advisor, an insurance agent, and an estate planning attorney and then you'd still be left with a long to do list of forms, that are out-of-date as soon as they are done.  Instead, Tomorrow designed a visual way to help you get organized and make financial decisions for your family's future. You'll quickly forget why you put this off for so long and will feel good getting everything done at once.  Tomorrow built a one-of-a-kind platform from the ground up to help families make important legal, insurance, and financial decisions—without having to waste time and energy doing it the old-fashioned way.	n/a	@tomorrowideas	https://angel.co/tomorrow-ideas	n/a	https://www.linkedin.com/company/tomorrow-ideas-inc./	https://www.facebook.com/tomorrowideas/	n/a	active

filerskeepers	2018	Amsterdam, the Netherlands	Compliance	n/a	n/a	filerskeepers helps companies decide which retention period to choose per system or document category. filerskeepers provides data retention schedules that give insight into the legal maximum and minimum retention periods applicable in the countries relevant to them. This helps companies to justify why they are storing data (“for compliance with income tax rules”) and for how long (“for 10 years from the date following the end of the book year").   filerskeepers was inspired by a problem many companies experience: there was no simple way for IT, Legal, Compliance, HR, Sales, Finance, Health and Safety and other business departments to build records retention schedules and keep them up to date.   filerskeepers believes that companies should be able to know all retention periods that apply to them. It is our goal to make sure companies will be up to date about the latest data retention periods. At any time. This will allow companies to find their golden standard retention period that they can actually implement into their IT-systems.  As we got to know our users, we discovered that data retention is not a one-size-fits-all. Companies keep data of all shapes, sizes and types—they use it in many different ways. Our goal is to make a strategic data retention tool that allows you to know all data retention terms, to see changes in data retention laws realtime and to know what the golden standard your organisation should apply. 	https://www.filerskeepers.com	@filerskeepers	https://angel.co/filerskeepers	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/filerskeepers	https://www.linkedin.com/company/filerskeepers	https://www.facebook.com/filerskeepers	data compliance, data retention, records retention	active

EDZ Systems	2015	Overland Park, Kansas	Document Automation	n/a	n/a	EDZ Systems Launches Intelligent RMSTM  First Tool of Its Kind to Integrate Law Firm Data In One Intelligent System  OVERLAND PARK, Kan. (August 28, 2018) – EDZ Systems today announced the launch of Intelligent RMS, a software solution designed to make law firms and corporate legal departments more informed, adaptable and strategic by bringing together all of their data on one intelligent platform.  Most law firms don’t lack data. They have a significant volume of business intelligence from multiple software sources – matter management, timekeeping, finance, human resources, marketing and more – as well as offline documents. However, as this information sits in disconnected systems and spreadsheets, law firm leaders don’t get a complete view of the business.  That’s where Intelligent RMS can help, said Elizabeth DeZeeuw, the president and CEO of EDZ Systems.  “Unlike any other product on the market today, Intelligent RMS helps legal teams see the big picture so they can make better decisions faster. This can lead to smarter business development, resource utilization and client management, as well as revenue growth and cost elimination,” she said. “It provides law firms the actionable optics to deliver better service for their clients and stronger profit for their partners.”  How it Works  Data visibility has been a critically lacking component of law firm management, DeZeeuw said. According to a study by FRONTEO, just 40 percent of law firms have dashboarding capabilities, compared to nearly three-fourths of corporations.  Indeed, data is often spread across law firms in separate systems that don’t integrate. Intelligent RMS brings together data from existing siloed applications into a single real-time display.  It’s common for law firms to use one provider for timekeeping and billing, and another for financial analysis, and still another for client contact information, DeZeeuw said. Intelligent RMS works across vendors, platforms and technologies; it can incorporate data onto a law firm dashboard regardless of source.  Corporate legal departments also can utilize Intelligent RMS to streamline their data and resources, DeZeeuw said.  Doug Doerfler, a former AmLaw 200 chief financial officer and Intelligent RMS user, said the software delivers ROI for law firms by improving efficiency, eliminating manual processes and focusing resources on the activities that matter most.  “In more than 20 years, I have not seen such a valuable solution,” Doerfler said. “This platform fills an important gap for firms, providing leaders real-time visibility across their business – and access to information in seconds. This increases efficiency in key areas: resource, matter, project, practice and lateral management.”  As a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product, Intelligent RMS is available for a per-user monthly fee plus an implementation charge based on firm size. There are no hardware or server requirements.  Following integration – which is estimated to take days, not months– users have access to centralized data and can create custom displays or dashboards.  More information is available at www.edzsystems.com.  About the Company  Based in Overland Park, Kan., EDZ Systems was founded by technology professionals that were former executives at DST Systems, an international leader in financial and healthcare software solutions. Their corporate experience inspired Intelligent RMS.  A certified minority- and woman-owned firm, EDZ Systems offers law firm users a foundation of industry best practices and technologies. Prior to launch, the company tested and validated Intelligent RMS in AmLaw 200 firms.

Blika Solutions AB	1989	Stockholm	Marketplace	n/a	n/a	The Blika platform is the starting point for the digitalization of the legal department and will help you to collect various types of data in a structured process. The solution is developed in modules which means that you can start with the modules you currently need and scale up at a later date by easily switching on additional modules.   All modules are integrated and information is therefore available where it is needed and you avoid double entry of data. In addition, you will be able to automate manual work when working in an integrated one system solution.   Many times several departments use the same base information, e.g. legal entity information and ownership structure, which makes it possible to increase efficiency by having several departments work in the solution (and share the cost).

The result is better decision making (maximizing settlements), improved intake processes (knowing which cases to take on) and increased intake efficiency (requiring less attorney time).

iolex limited	2018	Hong Kong	Compliance	n/a	n/a	iolex limited helps law firms and their clients digitize their legal / compliance functions.  to this end, iolex offers (1)unified platform + legal tech app store (2)a proprietary high level language that lawyers and compliance officers can use to create their own apps, bypassing the programmer, and (3)a road map for redefining end-to-end legal service.  Think of the company ARM for lawyers.  iolex's founder and CEO Carl Im, a stanford phd in physics, with 20 years of investment banking trading, strategy, and sales experience, believes that the single most distinguishing factor of iolex is the tech leadership:  (1)status quo is to implement legaltech solution within the context of a given mandate --> iolex builds law firm business models around a suite of technology.  (2)status quo is to teach low level programming to lawyers --> we have trained 4 lawyers to speak iolex(a proprietary high level language) to create their own apps, bypassing the programmer.  We have apps with only 20 lines of iolex, and over 500 lines of iolex.  Carl Im is also a senior advisor to Yulchon LLC.  As a senior adviser at Yulchon LLC, he has been driving Yulchon’s digital strategy, eYulchon using the iolex paradigm.  Carl was named one of the 10 pioneers of new thinking by the London Financial Times, and his work has won the Asian Technology and Innovation Initiative of the Year, the Asia-Pacific Innovator of the Year, and the In-House Community Visionary Firm of the Year.  He has just published a paper in A.I. with MIT’s CSAIL.  The legal app factory that iolex is offering has created several revenue generating applications for Yulchon LLC and is currently in discussions with several international and regional law firms for collaboration.  Carl has just announced a FIDIC Yellow 99 compliance app in collaboration with Pinsent Masons.  At this years International Bar Association Conference, the iolex footprint in legaltech was the topic of invited talks for the Law Firm Management Committee, the Banking Law Committee, the Securities Law Committee, Stronger Together by Freshfields, the Fintech Settlement Committee, as well as the Yulchon Tax Breakfast.  Currently iolex offers three classes of applications: the award winning AlgoCompliance, legal risk assessment analytics, as well as the patent-pending semantic evolution engine, i7, that produces line-by-line reasoning for a legal argument.	 https://www.iolex.com	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	legal practice management, computational law, legal document automation, ediscovery, legal analytics, legal research	active

Legalicity	2015	10 Dundas Street East, Toronto ON  M5B 2G9	Analytics	n/a	n/a	Legalicity is the maker of NLPatent, an online tool that uses Artificial Intelligence to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. Our goal is to predict the success of patent applications, thereby reducing the uncertainty and the cost involved in seeking patent protection.  There are over 3,000,000 patent applications filed each year around the world, and that number is growing. But many of these applications are rejected, often because the proposed invention is too similar to existing technology. That means a lot of resources are wasted on unsuccessful applications, since getting a patent is very costly and time-consuming. NLPatent uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to evaluate the patentability of new ideas. This helps companies and inventors decide whether an invention is worth pursuing.

RechtEasy.at	2012	Staudgasse 54, Vienna, Austria, Europe	Legal Research	n/a	n/a	With over 6000 legal terms, RechtEasy.at - which was nominated as "Best Legal Tech Innovation 2019 service provider" - is Austria's largest free legal research tool. It was created in 2012 in cooperation with the university and its legal faculty representatives due to the need to explain Austrian legal terms in a transparent and simple manner, differentiated from German law. Most of the terms were created directly by our team in a phase of a year where we did nothing but to write articles. The long-awaited relaunch then took place in March 2019, which caused a sensation inside and outside the legal sector. Since then, the platform not only show legal terms, but also display all federal laws, including judicature, among the paragraphs and links them together.  In addition, there is a new and intuitive legal job advertisement plattform. Appropriate advertisements from the integrated job portal are automatically suggested to users who are looking for a legal term in the relevant field. Without being actively looking for a job, this networking opens up completely new options that one might not have even considered personally.  In order to offer users additional added value, successive explanatory videos are added to the respective legal terms. Well-known lawyers from Austria were won over as experts.	 https://www.rechteasy.at	@rechteasy	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	wiki, legal research, rechteasy	active

Estate Apps LLC	2020	San Francisco, CA	Marketplace	n/a	CourtCorrect tells you what's in all the terms and conditions and contracts you just accept.	Estate App LLC develops Apps that enable law firms to solve legal client issues while boosting the law firms' marketing.    The Estate Attorney App available on iOS and Android enables law firms to provide clients with a property memo generation tool for completing a property memo -- something that nearly 70% of clients currently do not complete.  The property memo is essential as it designates who is to get a client's personal items upon their death.  Without a completed property memo, beneficiaries are left to divide the sentimental items themselves leading to fights among family members.  An unfinished memo is also a loss for the law firm as it means the firm misses out on billable work reviewing the memo for legal compliance.   The Estate Attorney App enables subscribing law firms to provide a tool that empowers clients by removing the previous barriers to creating the memo.  Specifically, the barriers in the past was the memo was 1) difficult to put together with items located in various places (e.g., banks, closets, locker storage) but having to type it into a desktop computer (solution: mobile app) and 2) difficult to describe similarly looking items (e.g., jewelry or clothing) with just words (solution: include pictures).  The App solves all these problems by making memo generation simple, and importantly, when the memo is to be updated in the future, the information is stored within the device.    The App is also a marketing tool as law firm information is displayed every time the client opens the App and provides an in device annual notification reminding clients to consider updating their estate plan.  It enables law firms to stand apart from other firms while clients perceive the firm as providing high-value.	n/a	n/a	n/a	n/a	https://www.linkedin.com/company/estate-apps	n/a	n/a	active
